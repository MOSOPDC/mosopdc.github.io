        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Ogoni is an ethnic group in Nigeria that primarily resides in the Niger Delta region of the country, specifically in the southern part of the Rivers State. The Ogoni people are known for their rich cultural heritage and are part of the larger Ogoni-speaking population.</p>
        <p>One of the most notable figures associated with the Ogoni people is Ken Saro-Wiwa, an environmental activist and writer who gained international recognition for his efforts to draw attention to the environmental and social impacts of oil extraction in Ogoniland. Saro-Wiwa and the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) campaigned against the negative effects of oil exploration and demanded greater autonomy and control over the resources in their region.</p>
        <p>The Ogoni struggle for environmental justice and local control over resources became widely recognized in the 1990s, and it led to a series of protests, clashes with the Nigerian government, and ultimately, the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists in 1995. This event brought global attention to the issues faced by the Ogoni people and sparked discussions about corporate responsibility, environmental protection, and indigenous rights.</p>
        <p>Since then, there have been ongoing efforts to address the environmental degradation in Ogoniland and the broader Niger Delta region, but the issues remain complex and challenging. Ogoni and other communities in the Niger Delta continue to face various social, economic, and environmental challenges related to the oil industry.</p>
